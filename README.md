Hey everyone,

I've been demystifying the AI "black box" by building a tiny Large Language Model from scratch, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's amazing work. It's wild how it all comes together. Here's the shortcut version of how it works:

1.  The Alphabet: You start with textâ€”in my case, Andrej's famous Shakespeare dataset. The first step is to teach the model its "alphabet" by turning every character or word into a number. This process, called tokenization, is a fundamental concept in NLP. For more on this, see the paper on Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), a common subword tokenization method: [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909).

2.  The Brain: The heart of the model is the Transformer architecture. Think of it as a super-smart brain that uses attention to focus on the most important parts of the text to understand context. This entire architecture was introduced in one of the most influential papers in modern AI: [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

3.  The Schooling: You "train" the model by repeatedly showing it the text and having it guess the next character. With each guess, you correct it, and over thousands of iterations, it gets smarter and smarter at predicting what comes next. The optimizer used to efficiently correct these guesses, known as Adam, is detailed in the paper: [Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980).

That's it. It's a simple, elegant process that's the foundation for some of the most powerful tech we use today. Definitely a great way to go from "magic" to "I get it."
